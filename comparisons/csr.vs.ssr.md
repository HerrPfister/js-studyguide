Server Side Rendering (SSR) vs Client Side Rendering (CSR)

## Pros SSR

1) Higher SEO (Search Engine Optimization) ranking
2) Better user experience
3) Don't need JS to see the website

## Cons SSR

1) Slower page transitions
2) Server cost
3) Complex caching

## Pros CSR

1) Speed of a standard js app
2) Easy Caching

## Cons CSR

1) Poor SEO out of the box
2) Poor user experience on 1st page load

> Go with Isomorphic for the best of both worlds, which utilizes SSR's initial page rendering and CSR's blazing speed when the js is loaded.
